Software Engineer, Applied AI
Engineering

New York 🗽
The Role
We're looking for a product-minded, applied AI engineer to lead our agentic work in LM Studio. You bring a scientific method mindset: design experiments, visualize results, run ablations, and explain what moves quality and speed. You know the literature and can implement from papers, but you are a practitioner first — a serious software engineer who builds robust systems fast. Your work turns into product features immediately across our app and API.

Your mandate will be to push the usefulness of on-device AI beyond what is commonly considered possible. Your work will directly translate into features we ship to millions of home and business users.

Qualifications
Empirical research mindset: design experiments, visualize results, run ablations.
Interest in building products for users and keeping a feedback loop with customers.
4+ years building production software (Python or C++. TypeScript a plus).
Strong algorithms background.
Compensation
$165,000 – $350,000 USD (offering equity)
Who We Are
We aim to build delightful and potent creation tools for AI. We are a small team based in New York. Everyone on the team is IC-minded, intellectually curious, self-motivated, and loves software. We care deeply about our user community and we strive to build canonical software that users and developers love.

Our products include the LM Studio desktop app, our developer SDKs: lmstudio-js and lmstudio-python, our CLI lms, MLX engine mlx-engine for M-chip Macs, venvstacks which enables us to ship Python-based software, the collaboration Hub for individuals and teams, and more currently being built.
